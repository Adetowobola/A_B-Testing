# A_B-Testing


A/B testing was used to compare user responses to two conditions: an experimental group that received targeted advertising and a control group that received either a public service announcement or no intervention. The key metric was the conversion rate, defined as the number of conversions per number of Total users.



Objectives:



-Analyze the experimental and control groups to determine if the ads were successful


-Estimate the potential revenue generated from the ads


-Assess the statistical significance of the differences between the groups using A/B testing techniques


Goals:



Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing adverts (experimental) compared to the control group using the A/B test method.

To quantify the impact of marketing measures on user behavior, particularly with regard to the conversion rate

Determine the impact of marketing on business outcomes, such as revenue generation and return on investment (ROI). A/B testing provides important insights into consumer behavior and can be used in various industries such as retail, healthcare, finance and travel.
