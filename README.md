#Evaluating the Impact of Marketing Campaigns

In a fast paced world like we experience daily, every company seeks one means of the other to maintain profitability and gain quantifiable market share. For marketing companies they focus on consistently running successful campaigns in a complex and competitive market.

For this to be possible, they set up on A/B testing systems, a randomized experimentation method that involves presenting different versions of a variable (such as a web page, banner, or ad) to separate segments of the audience simultaneously. This approach helps determine which version has the most significant impact on business metrics.

To address these questions, the company conducted an A/B test, where the majority of participants were exposed to ads (the experimental group) and a smaller portion saw a Public Service Announcement (PSA) or nothing (the control group).

About the Dataset

Feature	Description

Row Index	Row index

User ID	Unique identifier for each user

Test Group	Indicates whether the user was in the "ad" group (saw the advertisement) or the "psa" group (saw the public service announcement or nothing)

Converted	Indicates whether the user bought the product (True) or not (False)

Total Ads	The number of ads seen by the user

Most Ads Day	The day when the user saw the highest number of ads

Most Ads Hour	The hour of the day when the user saw the highest number of ads


Objective
The primary objective of this case study is to perform hypothesis testing on the e-commerce dataset to compare different groups or features. Specifically, we aim to:

Analyze the experimental and control groups to determine if the ads were successful.

Estimate the potential revenue generated from the ads.

Assess the statistical significance of the differences between the groups using A/B testing techniques.



A_B-Testing


A/B testing was used to compare user responses to two conditions: an experimental group that received targeted advertising and a control group that received either a public service announcement or no intervention. The key metric was the conversion rate, defined as the number of conversions per number of Total users.



Objectives:



-Analyze the experimental and control groups to determine if the ads were successful


-Estimate the potential revenue generated from the ads


-Assess the statistical significance of the differences between the groups using A/B testing techniques


Goals:



Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing adverts (experimental) compared to the control group using the A/B test method.

To quantify the impact of marketing measures on user behavior, particularly with regard to the conversion rate

Determine the impact of marketing on business outcomes, such as revenue generation and return on investment (ROI). A/B testing provides important insights into consumer behavior and can be used in various industries such as retail, healthcare, finance and travel.
